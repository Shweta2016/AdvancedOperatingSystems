********************* Project: Disk scheduling algorithms ***************

Problem Statement:

Suppose that a disk drive has 5000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder 2255, and the previous request was at cylin-der 1723. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO order, is:
2055, 1175, 2304, 2700, 513, 1680, 256, 1401, 4922, 3692

For each of the following disk-scheduling algorithms, starting from the current head position, what is the order of cylinders visited by the head?
